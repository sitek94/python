# Python

Learning a bit about Python with my morning oatmeal ðŸ¥£

## [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)

The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). He is a Clinical Professor at the
University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including
programming, database design, and web development.

## Resources

- [Internet History, Technology and Security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-history) - another course by Dr.
